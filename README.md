# 🌫️ AQI Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning regression techniques. AQI is a key indicator of air pollution, and accurate predictions can help raise public awareness and support health-related decision-making.

---

## 📊 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can **predict AQI values** based on input features such as pollutant levels, temperature, humidity, and more.
